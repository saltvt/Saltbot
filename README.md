# Saltbotv2 
Chatbot 
The goal of this project is to create my own LLM/NN for stream purposes and to document the experience. First versions will be using chatterbot and then the subsequent versions will be using Pytorch. Tensorflow IS NOT IT. XD. This first version should be fully functional even though it's simple. Will ad more when I get more comfortable with the data and math.

Use of this repository is free. Do not redistribute or pay money for any of the code in this repository, I want this to be free of use so the only need is compute.
